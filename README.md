### Hello! ðŸ¤˜

:bowtie: , my name is Rafael Nakashima, i'm from Mogi das Cruzes, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I have a degree in mechanical engineering, but on the road on developer life since August/2021.

If you want to talk to me, my interests are **Surf** :surfer:, **rave parties** and **electronic music** :sunglasses:, **fantasy books** :books: (a Patrick Rothfuss fan) ,**RPG games** :star2:,  **NFTs** in general :monkey_face: ... what do you think about Metaverse ? And of course, **programming** :computer: . But i'm open to discover new ideas, so in short we can talk about anything :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
